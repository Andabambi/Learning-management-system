<div class="question">
<br>1) A company is migrating a legacy application to Amazon EC2. The application uses a user name and
password stored in the source code to connect to a MySQL database.<br> The database will be migrated to an
Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance. As part of the migration, the company wants to implement a secure
way to store and automatically rotate the database credentials.</br>
<br>Which approach meets these requirements ?</br>

<input type="radio" id="vehicle" name="vehicle1" value="Bike">A) Store the database credentials in environment variables in an Amazon Machine Image (AMI). Rotate the
credentials by replacing the AMI.<br>
<input type="radio" id="vehicle" name="vehicle1" value="Bike">B) Store the database credentials in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. Configure Parameter Store to
automatically rotate the credentials.<br>
<input type="radio" id="vehicle" name="vehicle1" value="Bike">C) Store the database credentials in environment variables on the EC2 instances. Rotate the credentials by
relaunching the EC2 instances.<br>
<input type="radio" id="vehicle" name="vehicle1" value="Bike">D) Store the database credentials in AWS Secrets Manager. Configure Secrets Manager to automatically
rotate the credentials.<br>

    <br>2) A developer is designing a web application that allows the users to post comments and receive nearreal-time feedback.<br>
    Which architectures meet these requirements? (Select TWO.)<br>
    
    <input type="radio" id="vehicle1" name="vehicle1" value="Bike">A) Create an AWS AppSync schema and corresponding APIs. Use an Amazon DynamoDB table as the data

    3) A developer is adding sign-up and sign-in functionality to an application. The application is required to<br>
     make an API call to a custom analytics solution to log user sign-in events.<br>
    Which combination of actions should the developer take to satisfy these requirements? (Select TWO.)
    <br><input type="checkbox" id="vehicle1" name="vehicle1" value="Bike">A) Use Amazon Cognito to provide the sign-up and sign-in functionality.
    <br><input type="checkbox" id="vehicle1" name="vehicle1" value="Bike">B) Use AWS IAM to provide the sign-up and sign-in functionality.
    <br><input type="checkbox" id="vehicle1" name="vehicle1" value="Bike">C) Configure an AWS Config rule to make the API call triggered by the post-authentication event.
    <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle1" name="vehicle1" value="Bike">D) Invoke an Amazon API Gateway method to make the API call triggered by the post-authentication event.<br>

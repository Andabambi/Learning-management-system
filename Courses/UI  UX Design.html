    -<h2>UI Design</h2>

    <p><b>-What is UI Design?</b>
    “UI” in UI design stands for “user interface.” The user interface is the graphical layout of an application. It consists of the buttons users click on, the text they read, the images, sliders, text entry fields, and all the rest of the items the user interacts with. This includes screen layout, transitions, interface animations and every single micro-interaction. Any sort of visual element, interaction, or animation must all be designed.

    <br>
    <p>This job falls to UI designers.
     They decide what the application is going to look like. They have to choose color schemes and button shapes — the width of lines and the fonts used for text.
     UI designers create the look and feel of an application's user interface.</p>

    UI design process by Ramotion
    UI designers are graphic designers.
     They're concerned with aesthetics.
     It's up to them to make sure the application's interface is attractive,
     visually-stimulating and themed appropriately to match the purpose and/or personality of the app.
     And they need to make sure every single visual element feels united, both aesthetically, and in purpose.</p>

    <h2>UX Design</h2>
    
    <p><strong>What is UX Design?</strong></p>
    
    <p>-UX design, or user experience design, 
    is the process of creating products and experiences that help users get done what they've come to do—as efficiently and effectively as possible.
    But what is user experience? In short, the user experience is how users feel as they engage with your product. 
    This concept applies to physical objects and daily experiences, like using a coffee maker or buying a car at a dealership;
     but it also applies to the digital side of life—think about the last time you transferred money using a banking app, purchased something online, or even played a game on your phone. 
    How each of these apps or websites are designed, combined with your needs and goals as you engage with them,
     create the user experience.</p>

    UX Bootcamps can take anywhere between 2 to 10 months to complete. In general, UX bootcamps introduce students to basic UX concepts and guide them through projects so they can begin building a portfolio.
     Some programs also include career mentorship and the chance to work with real clients.</p>

    <p>UX design is the process of understanding and empathizing with the actual needs and goals of your users, diving into that user experience,
     locating the problems (often called “pain points”), and finding solutions that result in a better user experience. 
    Good UX design often flies just under your radar—unless it's just a really outstanding experience, if the UX is good, you don't notice it.,
    Things are just working the way they're supposed to. But bad UX? You'll spot it every time, 
    and chances are that you won't be very interested in repeating your experience with that product.</p>

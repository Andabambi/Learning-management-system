<h2>End-User Computing</h2>

<p>
It's most strict sense, end-user computing (EUC) refers to computer systems and platforms that help non-programmers create applications.
However, there is a lot more to EUC and its related technology, virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI),
which essentially hosts desktop environments on a central server.
It is considered a form of desktop virtualization.
Key to the success of an EUC/VDI initiative is bringing the components of the platform to users and managers without requiring systems expertise,
allowing a more fluid introduction of new technologies to end users. </p>

<p>its most strict sense, end-user computing (EUC) refers to computer systems and platforms that help non-programmers
create applications.
However, there is a lot more to EUC and its related technology,
virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI),
which essentially hosts desktop environments on a central server.
It is considered a form of desktop virtualization.</p>

<br>
<p>Key to the success of an EUC/VDI initiative is bringing the components of the platform to users and
managers without requiring systems expertise,
allowing a more fluid introduction of new technologies to end users. Given the scope of roles and responsibilities,
any platform that is used to support an initiative should be intuitive, agile, scalable, and manageable.
These features reduce the level of expertise required to keep up with the changing digital workplace.</p>

<br>
<br>
<p>
What's important is that a well-designed EUC/VDI plan can allow users to access the digital platforms they need to be productive,
both on-premises and working remotely in the cloud.</p>

<h2>Why use EUC?</h2>

<p>It's no secret the work environment has changed dramatically.Businesses require new ways of working to survive,
remain successful and return to growth.
Resiliency and business continuity are driving organizations to redesign and recalibrate operations.
EUC/VDI is at the forefront as application delivery to a remote workforce becomes critical for success.
At the same time, today's users have changed.</p>

<br>
<p>As creators and consumers of content they demand access to increasingly rich data, images, video 
and sound in order to do their jobs, while some of the more extreme users need to interact with images at high precision.
Many organizations have all types of users,
from the task-based up to the 3D graphical image user.
The ability to change and adapt to these new requirements defines an organization. 
To achieve the required level of desktop flexibility, agility and mobility often requires new cloud optimized infrastructures that can be scaled on demand with simple,
automated, processes and tools.</p>

<br>

<br>
<h2>Remote offices</h2>
<p>For organizations with a diverse physical footprint, it can be challenging to deliver consistent digital workplace resources. 
An EUC/VDI solution offers an opportunity to deliver improved consistency in the desktop and access to user applications in remote offices. 
It's easy to add new users and troubleshooting tasks can be minimized.</p>

<br>
<h2>Compliance and licensing control</h2>
<p>For organizations that are concerned with regulatory compliance, 
or that want to improve management of their software licensing, 
an EUC/VDI environment can deliver a centralized platform for all user desktops and applications. 
With this centralized platform, security can be tightly managed and software licensing can be controlled. 
The EUC/VDI environment can be designed to provide everything that users need to perform their jobs while closely maintaining the range of external software installations by individual users.</p>

<br>
<br>
<h2>Why is end-user computing important?</h2>
<p>With EUC/VDI, the objective is to identify all the key applications or databases that are critical to daily operations and consolidate those into the same optimized platform as the desktops.
With this approach, the scope of systems that are responsible for daily operations is identified and optimized along with the user desktops in a solution that delivers the performance users require.
When using an efficient platform, the skills required to maintain the EUC/VDI environment are minimized,
and the skills required to maintain operations are lower.</p>

<br>
<br>
<p>Advances in cloud technology and integration have also greatly impacted EUC and VDI. Organizations now need multiple options to help enable worker productivity while also securing data, lowering costs, and managing highly variable workloads. A robust cloud infrastructure helps support that. A hybrid approach to physical, virtual and cloud desktops is inevitable  and a best practice.
NetAppÂ® cloud solutions for virtual desktops help you capitalize on the benefits of VDI in the cloud while avoiding many of the challenges around cost and complexity.</p>

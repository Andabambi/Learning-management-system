    <strong>Comptia A+</strong>

    <br>
    <h2>What Is CompTIA A+ Certification?</h2>
 
    <h2>What is CompTIA A+</h2>
    <p>The Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA) is an American non-profit trade association, issuing professional certifications for the information technology (IT) industry.
     It is considered one of the IT industry's top trade associations. Based in Downers Grove, Illinois, CompTIA issues vendor-neutral professional certifications in over 120 countries.
      The organization releases over 50 industry studies annually to track industry trends and changes. Over 2.2 million people have earned CompTIA certifications since the association was established.</p>
<br>
<br>
    <h2>More About CompTIA A+ :</h2>
    <p>The CompTIA A+ certification is an industry standard for those who wish to pursue a career in IT. The A+ consists of two exams, one focuses on cloud computing,
       hardware, and networking technology, while the other teaches you about software, operating systems, and cybersecurity basics. Let's take a look at what the CompTIA A+ is.</p>

      <p>The information technology industry is expected to reach a global value of $5 trillion in 2021. It is one of the fastest-growing industries globally, with the most significant development expected
       to happen in the emerging technology sector big data/analytics, IoT software, AR/VR, and similar. Other sectors, such as software, tech services, hardware, and telecom services, are not far behind.</p>
    
       <br>
  <h2>Trustmarks</h2>
   <p>The CompTIA Security Trustmark+ is based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and demonstrates compliance with key industry regulations such as PCI-DSS, SSAE-16, HIPAA, and others reliant on the NIST Framework.
     It is based on a third-party assessment of security policies, procedures and operations.
    CompTIA offered additional trustmarks, a Managed Services Trustmark and Managed Print Trustmark, that were retired on Sept. 30, 2021</p>

<strong>Full-Stack Mobile Development</strong>


<h2>What is Full Stack Mobile Development ?</h2>
<h2>What is Full Stack Mobile Development ?</h2>
<br>
<p>Mobile app development is the act or process by which a mobile app is developed for mobile devices, such as personal digital assistants, enterprise digital assistants or mobile phones.</p>

 <p>These software applications are designed to run on mobile devices, such as a smartphone or tablet computer. These applications can be pre-installed on phones during manufacturing platforms,
  or delivered as web applications using server-side or client-side processing (e.g., JavaScript) to provide an "application-like" experience within a web browser.</p>
  
  <br>
  <p>Application software developers also must consider a long array of screen sizes,
   hardware specifications, and configurations because of intense competition in mobile software and changes within each of the platforms. Mobile app development has been steadily growing, in revenues and jobs created. A 2013 analyst report estimates there are 529,000 direct app economy jobs within the EU then 28 members 
   (including the UK), 60 percent of which are mobile app developers.</p>

   <h2>Front-end development tools</h2>
<p>Front-end development tools are focused on the user interface and user experience (UI-UX) and provide the following abilities:</p>

<p>*UI design tools</p>
<p>*SDKs to access device features</p>
<p>Cross-platform accommodations/support</p>

<h2>Back-end servers</h2>
<p>Back-end tools pick up where the front-end tools leave off, and provide a set of reusable services that are centrally managed and controlled and provide the following abilities:</p>

<p>*Integration with back-end systems</p>
<p>*User authentication-authorization</p>
<p>*Data services</p>
<p>*Reusable business logic.</p>

Mobile app testing
Mobile applications are first tested within the development environment using emulators and later subjected to field testing. Emulators provide an inexpensive way to test applications on mobile phones to which developers may not have physical access. The following are examples of tools used for testing application across the most popular mobile operating systems.

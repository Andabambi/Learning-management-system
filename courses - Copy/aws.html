<p>Amazon Web Services, Inc. is a subsidiary of Amazon that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals,
    companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis. These cloud computing web services provide 
  distributed computingprocessing capacity and software tools via AWS server farms.</p>
               
  <br>
         <h1>Duration</h1>
<p>According to Amazon Web Services, the Foundational AWS certificate takesabout three to six months of study of AWS Cloud and
  IT industry concepts to pass the exam.Associate level AWS certificates may take a year of hands-on experience and study to qualify for </p>
     
  <h1>Modules</h1>
=======
<p>When you interact with AWS, you specify your AWS security credentials to verify who you are and
  whether you have permission to access the resources that you are requesting. AWS uses the security
  credentials to authenticate and authorize your requests.
  For example, if you want to download a protected file from an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon
  S3) bucket, your credentials must allow that access.<br> If your credentials aren't authorized to download the
  file, AWS denies your request. However, your AWS security credentials are not required  to download a file
  in an Amazon S3 bucket that is publicly shared.</p> 

  <h2>AWS account root user credentials and IAM usercredentials</h2>

  <p>There are two different types of users in AWS. You are either the account owner (root user) or you are
    an AWS Identity and Access Management<br> (IAM) user. The root user is created when the AWS account
    is created and IAM users are created by the root user or an IAM administrator for the<br> account. All AWS
    users have security credentials.</p>
  
                
         <h1>Duration</h1>
         <p>The minimum session duration is 1 hour, and can be set to a maximum of 12 hours. AWS SSO automatically creates IAM roles in each assigned account for<br> each permission set, and configures these roles with a maximum session duration of 12 hours.

                <h2>AWS security credentials</h2>
      <br>
<p>When you interact with AWS, you specify your AWS security credentials to verify who you are and
  whether you have permission to<br> access the resources that you are requesting. AWS uses the security
  credentials to authenticate and authorize your requests.
  For example,<br> if you want to download a protected file from an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon
  S3) bucket, your credentials must allow that access.<br> If your credentials aren't authorized to download the
  file, AWS denies your request. However, your AWS security credentials are not required<br>  to download a file
  in an Amazon S3 bucket that is publicly shared.<br></p> 

  <h2>AWS account root user credentials and IAM usercredentials</h2>

  <p>There are two different types of users in AWS. You are either the account owner (root user) or you are
    an AWS Identity and Access Management<br> (IAM) user. The root user is created when the AWS account
    is created and IAM users are created by the root user or an IAM administrator for the<br> account. All AWS
    users have security credentials.</p>
  
                
         <h1>Duration</h1>
         <p>The minimum session duration is 1 hour, and can be set to a maximum of 12 hours. AWS SSO automatically creates IAM roles in each assigned account for<br> each permission set, and configures these roles with a maximum session duration of 12 hours.
          According to Amazon Web Services, the Foundational AWS certificate<br>  takesabout three to six months of study of AWS Cloud and
  IT industry concepts to pass the exam.Associate level AWS certificates may take a year<br>  of hands-on experience and study to qualify for</p>
     <h1>Modules</h1>
     <br>
    <h2>AWS Cloud Products</h2>

   <P>computer:Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.Storage:Cloud storage is a cloud computing model that stores data on the Internet through a cloud computing provider who manages and</P>
   <p>operates data storage as a service. It’s delivered on demand with just-in-time capacity and costs, and eliminates buying and managing <br>
   your own data storage infrastructure. This gives you agility, global scale and durability, with “anytime, anywhere” data access.</P>


                  <h1> Modules</h1>

                <h2> Module 1:introduction and history</h2>
<p>2006: AWS (Amazon Web Services) was officially launched. 2007: In 2007, over 180,000 developers had signed up for the AWS. 2010:<br>
 In 2010, amazon.com retail web services were moved to the AWS, i.e.,amazon.com is now running on AWS. 2011: AWS suffered from some major problems<br>.</p>

                <h2>Module2</h2>

<P>AWS networking and content delivery services</p>
<P>Network foundations
Amazon-Virtual-Private-Cloud_48
Amazon VPC
Customize and control your networking environment with Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)</p>
<p>AWS-Transit-Gateway_Icon_32_Squid
AWS Transit Gateway
Simplify your network with VPCs and on-premises networks connected to a single gateway</p>
<P>AWS-PrivateLink_Icon_32_Squid
AWS PrivateLink
Establish private connectivity between VPCs and AWS or on- premises services</p>

                  <h2>module3- comuter services and networking</h2>

<p>In cloud computing, the term “compute” describes concepts and
 objects related to software computation. It is a generic term used to<br>
 reference processing power, memory, networking,
 storage, and other resources required for the computational success of any program.</p>
           <h2> module 4- managed services and database</h2>

<p>purpose Built
Choose from 15+ purpose-built database engines including relational, key-value, document, in-memory, graph,
 time series, wide column, and ledger databases.</p>
<p>Performance at Scale
Get relational databases that are 3-5X faster than popular alternatives, or non-relational databases that give you microsecond to sub-millisecond latency.</p>
<p>Fully Managed
AWS continuously monitors your clusters to keep your workloads running with self-healing storage and automated scaling,<br>
 so that you can focus on application development.Secure & Highly Available</p>
<p> databases are built for business-critical, enterprise workloads, offering high availability, reliability, and security</p>.<br>
                      
                                <h2>aws deployment and management</h2>
